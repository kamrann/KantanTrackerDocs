Features
- Plot float and integer properties in realtime for any actor, component or subobject in the world.
- Multiple properties from a single object on one plot, or alternatively plot the same property for multiple objects.
- Multiple simultaneous plots, optionally attached to different worlds (for multiplayer PIE).
- Data repository accessible from Blueprint or simple C++ macros allows for plotting values of intermediate calculations which do not have an associated property.
- Save and reload plot configurations to quickly repeat tests on different runs of PIE/editor.
- Save and reload actual plots for easy comparison between runs.
- Supports plotting at substep frequency for debugging manually substepped physics simulations.
